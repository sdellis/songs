This is a way for High Hearts to publish and manage all our songs.  Hopefully this will allow others to play them and us to remember them!

Many thanks to Hillel Arnold for [his code](https://github.com/helrond/songs).  He is also a great songwriter and folk singer.  [Check out his stuff!](http://songs.hillelarnold.com/)
